## Overview of Election Audit
We are assisting Tom, a Colorado Board of Election employee, with an election audit highlighting metrics such as the winner, the top performing congressional county and how many votes were cast in total. Tom boss is hoping that the code that is written will then be able to be applied across other congressional, senatorial and local elections.

## Election-Audit Results

### How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
There were 369,711 total votes casted in this election.

### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

### Which county had the largest number of votes?
Denver received the largest numver of votes.

### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

### Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes which accounts for 73.8% of the total votes in the election. 

### Election-Audit Summary
This audit can easily be repurposed for any election with just a couple of changes. The largest change that will need to be made is to update the file_to_load to properly connect it to a csv that has information on the election that you are interested in auditing. On top of that, you will want to update the file_to_save to allow for the code to be written to the correct place. Aside, from those two items, the code should properly run for other regions. If you were to want to add more information, like how each vote was cast, you would want to include that information in the csv as well as create additional code to allow for it to be properly displayed in the audit.
